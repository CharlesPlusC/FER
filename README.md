# Facial Emotion Recognition on Construction Sites 
*Initially attempted to make a Facial Emotion Recognition CNN based on FER2013 Kaggle Dataset. Attached model achieves around 67% accuracy.

*Subsequently decided to make use of DeepFace and get an 'engagement score' for each video in the aim of informing health and safety site inductions so as to make them more engaging and to ultimately improve site safety outcomes. 

*Jupyter notebooks used for the purposes of illustrating early thinking
